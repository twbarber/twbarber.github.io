summary: "Once on his feet, though, man does not stay where he is. A Philosophy of Walking covers the impact of traveling by foot on Nietzsche, Rousseau, Thoreau and others. While much of the book paints a wonderful picture of the solitude walking offers, there is still a good bit of filler that wanders off the beaten path. What Gros really describes is something closer to what Americans call hiking, but you'll be left with an itch to fit even a short stroll into your daily schedule."

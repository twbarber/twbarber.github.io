summary: "Once on his feet, though, man does not stay where he is. A Philosophy of Walking covers the impact of traveling by foot on Nietzsche, Rousseau, Thoreau and others. Even though Gros describes something closer to what Americans call hiking, you'll be left with an itch to schedule a daily stroll."

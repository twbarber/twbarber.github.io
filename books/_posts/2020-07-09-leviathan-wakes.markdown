summary: "The first book of the series 'The Expanse', Leviathan Wakes is an epic space opera from start to finish. The story follows the crew of The Canturbury; an ice hauling space freighter that finds itself the catalyst of a war between Earth, Mars, and a set of colonies between them called The Belt. The most interesting part of the book is its apparent setting in the not-so-distant future. A future seemingly within reach if humanity were to invent technology akin to the book's universe's Epstein Drive for fast efficient space travel."

summary: "A follow up to 'Deep Work', Cal Newport covers the role that social media plays in most everyone's daily life. Newport takes the stance that the way to a satisfying life is through finding meaning in how we spend our time. Build something. Practice something and seek feedback. Uninstall Facebook. A great pairing with his last novel that explores the time wasters of our leisure time, and how to overcome them."

summary: "I struggle to rate this. On one hand, the message of focusing on what matters is becoming increasingly important as the world starts to both lose it's ability to spend long hours on a single subject and get lost in the sea of social media distractions. On the other, the general content is pretty uninspiring and I wish the book offered a more tactical approach towards how to accomplish determining what is essential and acting on it."

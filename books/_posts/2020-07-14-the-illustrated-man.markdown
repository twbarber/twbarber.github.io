summary: "Another great book of short stories from Ray Bradbury. Like the Martian Chronicles, this clearly comes from a time where getting to Mars and beyond was humanity's next Manifest Destiny. The theme of atomic war on Earth is also a strong focus. With my experience of Bradbury being limited to this, The Martian Chronicles, and Farenheit 451, I'm left wondering about the anxieties the early years of the Cold War imparted on him."

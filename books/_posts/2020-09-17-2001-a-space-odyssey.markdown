summary: "The Sci-fi classic by Aruth C. Clarke holds up over 50 years later. A genuine trip in many senses of the word, the story follows humanity discovering the cosmos in a way that feels remarkably achievable today. I guarantee you'll be itching to watch the Stanley Kubrick film adaptation as soon as you finish."

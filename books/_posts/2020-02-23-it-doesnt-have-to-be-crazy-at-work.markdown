summary: "\"A calm company is a choice\", argue the founders of the software company, Basecamp. 80-hour work weeks, prioritizing bottom line growth over people, all-nighters, and days paralyzed monitoring chat are all optional. By focusing on making choices that are closer to calm than crazy, Basecamp has built an enviable culture. Some of the practices like a four day work week during the summer could be a bear to adapt, but others are less invasive, and can bring more balance to your work-life."

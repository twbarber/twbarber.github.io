summary: "How do the reading patterns encouraged by content on the internet affect our ability to focus when reading long-form? _Reader Come Home_ explores how the internet is changning how we read, focus, and grow in a world of blog posts and tweets. Marryanne Wolf explains what we're missing out on by dismissing books, and how detrimental it can be to the minds of our children. An excellent read for those wanting to combat the internet's preference for hot takes and click bait."

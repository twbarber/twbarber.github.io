summary: "The founders of the Chicago Google office tackle building and maintaining teams. While initially written to cover teams working on software products, Debugging Teams covers a broad array of strategies to keep teams in any field happy and engaged. Humility, respect, and trust are the basis of all productive teams, they argue, and it's hard to disagree. Plenty of topics are covered from finding meaning in what the team is working on, to how to deal with bad eggs."

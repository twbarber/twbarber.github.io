summary: "Perhaps more relevant today than it was in 1992, Technopoly argues that America has surrendered it's culture to technology. Neil Postman believes that we've crossed a barrier from treating technology as a tool, to now worshipping it and treating everything new as progress. Without looking at a technology's side effects, he argues, we can't rightfully appreciate if it's actually a net benefit to our lives. One is left wondering what Postman would've thought about the constant connection of smartphones, social media, and the state of endless entertainment we find ourselves in today."

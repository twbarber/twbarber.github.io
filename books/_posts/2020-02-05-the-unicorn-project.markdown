summary: "A story of agility, progress, and momentum under the constraints of corporate bureaucracy, The Unicorn Project shows how even businesses with the most dire technical debt can right the ship and become a market leader. Running parallel with the events of The Phoenix Project, the value of empowering engineers, encouraging innovation, and being customer focused is pressed upon the reader. A great read for anyone looking to be a spark of change in their engineering organization, or for selling the value of good engineering practices to non-engineers."

summary: "The folks at Basecamp do it again with a look into their ways of working. Shape Up digs into the hard details of ideation, prioritization, and execution. Shaping ideas and betting on them leads to clearer goals while maintaining a level of agency for engineers and designers. Strongly recommended for anyone looking to buck the treadmill of agile."

summary: "Matthew McConaughey shares a wild life story in his new book, Greenlights. From growing up in Texas, a wild senior year in Australia, to finding himself later in life in South America and Africa, the book offers up interesting stories of a privileged life. There's enough humility to keep things bearable, but the aggressive masculinity topped off with recounts of wet dreams makes this autobiographt feel a bit dated."

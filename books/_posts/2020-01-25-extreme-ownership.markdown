summary: "Extreme Ownership is a leadership mindset for maintaining absolute responsibility for the success of your team. The authors describe a number of behaviors to \"Check The Ego\", and provide great insight into putting your team in the best position to win. However, for a book that claims it \"isn't meant to be an individual's glorified war story\", they are discussed ad nauseam. 95% of the substance of this book can be gained from reading the 'Principle' and 'Application to Business' sections of each chapter."

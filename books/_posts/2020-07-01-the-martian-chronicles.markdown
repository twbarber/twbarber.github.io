summary: "A classic piece of science fiction that shows its age in regards to science, but not creativity. Bradbury's space adventure traverses generations of life on Mars, and offers some far out tales of time travel and Earth at war. The writing, as expected, is packed full of wonderful imagery, but prepare to get hung up on the scientific understanding and technical imagition of the 1950's."

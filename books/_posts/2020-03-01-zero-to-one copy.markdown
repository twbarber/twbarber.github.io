summary: "Peter Thiel argues for creation, instead of incrimental improvement, for those looking to build a company. He begins the book with a difficult question: 'What is something you think is true, but that most people disagree with you on?'. Can you answer that? The general argument is that novelty is better than copying, as it adds more to the world than just iterating on someone else's success. There are some bold idea's that resonate with the Silicon Valley ideology, and this book is worth a look for those striving to be the next Gates or Zuckerberg. Unfortunately, this ends up as antithesis for those looking to build a company while maintaining a healthy work life balance. "

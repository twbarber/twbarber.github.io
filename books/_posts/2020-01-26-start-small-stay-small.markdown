summary: "Packed with substance, unfortunately most of it is dated. Large portions of the book are dedicated to SEO and growth tools that have gone belly-up. The author does pose hard questions for Software Developers, like how practical is building an MVP yourself if it can be easily outsourced for cheap. Unfortunately, without a revised edition, the book is very promising in name but disappointing in content."

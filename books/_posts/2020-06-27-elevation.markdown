summary: "I can only assume this is a story about death. A short novel by King left me wanting much more. Scott's interactions with his neighbors are awkward and tough to relate too. The theme of death, however, is very present in King's mind. A quick read, and one that leaves me disappointed and yearning for more Stephen King on the back end of his career."

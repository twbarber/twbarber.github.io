summary: "A thorough and easy to understand (but difficult to finish) guide to mindfulness and vipasanna meditation. A great introduction to the what, how, and why of sitting. This book answered all of my outstanding questions about how to get started with mindfulness, although the later parts of the book felt quite repitive."

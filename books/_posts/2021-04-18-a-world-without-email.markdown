summary: "In good faith, 'A World Without Email' tries to offer an overview of and solutions for the humdrum of office busy-work. Cal Newport shares soft suggestions which amount to a little more than a shallow look at the current standards of working in the software engineering field. If you spend your days in anything related to software development, look elsewhere. You'll end up with a summary of how you work today, with little exploration into the pitfalls of modern agile practices, and how to overcome those issues when they eventually arise. Unfortunately, 'A World Without Email' ends up as Cal Newport's weakest entry in his growing series of productivity porn.

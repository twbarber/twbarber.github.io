summary: "Adrian Tchaikovsky delivers a sci-fi epic spanning at an unbelieveable scale. I genuinely can't express how much I loved every bit of this book. The unique swapping perspecitves of the pair of main characters makes you care for both of them deeply, and the ending leaves you struggling emotionally to pick a side. A fantastic read for any fiction fan, this book is sure to be a sci-fi classic."

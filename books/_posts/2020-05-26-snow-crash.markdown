summary: "Snow Crash is an intelligent story in a world of corporate overlords and no government. The cyberpunk distopia is painted almost as well as VR googles render the metaverse. A great story, save for the lackluster finish and awkward near-monologue 3/4 of the way through the book. Don't let it distract you from the fact that Hiro Protagonist may be the most badass pizza delivery driver to ever live."

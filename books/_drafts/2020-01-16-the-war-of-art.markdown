summary: "A charming reminder of what's stopping us from creating: Resistance. The voice holding us back from starting work by casting doubt, fear, or convincing you it's easier to stay an extra hour in bed, or drink beer on the couch and binge watch. Despite the relatable theme, the brevity and mound of fluff outweigh the substance. Recommend only if you need a quick pickup to get going on making something meaningful."
